      <strong>Professor Takahito Mitsui has joined the lab</strong><br>
      Professor Takahito Mitsui has joined our lab as a specially appointed assistant professor.<br>
      He conducts research aiming to understand climate variability such as glacial–interglacial cycles, Dansgaard–Oeschger cycles, the current interglacial period and its future, and the Indian summer monsoon. His methods include Earth system models, data assimilation using nonlinear Kalman filters, time series prediction using neural networks such as reservoir computing, and simple dynamical system models.
      He is also participating in the Kotsuki Project related to Moonshot Goal 8: "Control of extreme weather."
