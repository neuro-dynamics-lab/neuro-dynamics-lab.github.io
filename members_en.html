          <h3>Keita Tokuda, Ph.D.</h3>
          <p>Associate Professor</p>
          <p>Degrees: Ph.D. (Information Science and Technology), M.S. (Pharmaceutical Sciences)</p>
          <p>Main research topic: Mathematical modeling of the nervous system</p>
          <p>Academic societies: The Japan Neuroscience Society, The Physical Society of Japan, The Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence, The Japanese Neural Network Society, Society for Neuroscience (SfN)</p>
          <p>Place of origin: Suginami-ku, Tokyo</p>
          <p>He studied up to a master’s degree at the University of Tokyo, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, and conducted research on learning and memory using electrophysiological and behavioral neuroscience methods. During his master’s studies, he became interested in using mathematics in biological research and shifted to mathematical modeling of the brain from the doctoral stage. He served as a research fellow in the FIRST Aihara Advanced Mathematical Sciences Project at the Institute of Industrial Science, University of Tokyo; as a researcher and assistant professor in the Department of Pharmacy at the University of Tokyo Hospital; and as an assistant professor in the Faculty of Engineering, Information and Systems at the University of Tsukuba before assuming his current position. He is working to clarify the physiology and pathology of the central nervous system using mathematical methods such as dynamical systems and machine learning.</p>
          <p>He also holds concurrent positions as a Collaborative Researcher at the International Research Center for Neurointelligence (IRCN), The University of Tokyo, and a Collaborating Researcher at the Beyond AI Institute, The University of Tokyo.</p>
