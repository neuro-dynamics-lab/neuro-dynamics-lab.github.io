      <h2>Research</h2>

<p>

Hello everyone. I’m Tokuda, leading the Neurodynamics Laboratory in the Faculty of Health Data Science at Juntendo University. In this lab, our research focuses on two central themes: “understanding the mechanisms of the brain through mathematics” and “predicting and controlling complex natural phenomena.” Although the brain and weather may seem unrelated at first glance, they share common structures and behaviors when viewed from the mathematical perspective of nonlinear dynamical systems.
</br></br>

Back in high school, I was fascinated by textbook diagrams of neurons and developed a deep curiosity: “How do emotions and thoughts emerge from what are merely physical cells?” This led me into neuroscience. I entered the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, where many labs focused on brain research, and conducted electrophysiological experiments through the master’s program. While this research was highly engaging, I was introduced to the idea of using mathematics to study biology, which was a revelation. Until then, I had avoided and struggled to understand university-level mathematics, but I finally began to appreciate its appeal. I was particularly struck by how mathematics could powerfully describe complex systems without reducing them to isolated elements. With this excitement, I took a leap of faith and entered the world of applied mathematics in my doctoral studies—and have continued working with mathematical models ever since.
</br></br>

Our lab, led by myself (Tokuda) and specially appointed Assistant Professor Mitsui, tackles a wide range of topics including neuroscience, meteorology, nonlinear dynamics, chemistry, biology, AI, and machine learning. Dr. Mitsui, who has research experience in Belgium and Germany, explores topics vital to the planet’s “health,” such as climate change and control of heavy rainfall.
</br>

Although the topics may appear diverse, they are unified by a common goal: “mathematically describing time-evolving systems.” Whether neuroscience, meteorology, or chemical reactions, our approach aims to understand these seemingly different phenomena under a unified mathematical framework.
</br></br>

The lab began with just me, Tokuda, in 2023. Undergraduate student assignments are still ahead, but the lab already includes Dr. Mitsui, doctoral students, PhD students who regularly travel from other universities, international students, undergraduates who came independently to study, and technical assistants. We are also actively collaborating with researchers from other faculties and universities on a daily basis.
</br></br>

Research is a continuous series of challenges—and it is also a source of great enjoyment. Defining your own questions, struggling through trial and error, and still arriving at new discoveries brings an incomparable sense of joy. I myself experienced many difficulties as a student—and still do even now—but every one of them has been part of the research journey and has become a valuable skill in life.
</br></br>

Recently, we’ve actively participated in international conferences. For example, we presented a poster at a geoscience conference in Vienna and engaged in discussions with researchers from around the world. Connecting with the world through research is another major appeal.
</br></br>

We explore the dynamics underlying various natural phenomena such as the “brain” and “weather” using mathematics and data science. If you have a desire to “understand the world more deeply” or “bring your own ideas to life,” please come visit our lab. Let’s conduct research that opens the future together.
